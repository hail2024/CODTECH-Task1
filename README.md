OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: Simple Calculator using Python(GUI)
Objective

A Python GUI calculator typically refers to a graphical user interface application built using Python programming language to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here's an overview of what such a calculator typically involves:

User Interface (UI):

Display: A window or frame where numbers and operations are displayed.
Buttons: Interface elements for digits (0-9), decimal point (.), operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions (like clear, equals).
Functionality:

Basic Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).
Clearing and Resetting: A button to clear the current input or reset the entire calculation.
Decimal Handling: Ability to input and compute with decimal numbers.
Error Handling: Basic validation to handle errors like division by zero.
Implementation:

Tkinter Library: Often used for creating the GUI components in Python.
Event Handling: Functions to handle button clicks and update the display accordingly.
Logic for Calculations: Functions that interpret user input and perform the arithmetic operations.
Example Features:

Memory Functions: Store and recall numbers from memory.
Scientific Mode: Additional functions for scientific calculations (trigonometric functions, square root, etc.).
History: Display previous calculations for reference.
Development Steps:

Design UI: Lay out the calculator display and buttons using Tkinter's widgets.
Implement Functionality: Define functions for handling button clicks and performing calculations.
Integrate Components: Connect the UI elements with the calculation logic.
Testing: Verify that all operations work correctly and handle edge cases (like large numbers, unexpected input).
Deployment:

Packaging: Use tools like PyInstaller to create standalone executable files for easy distribution.
Documentation: Provide clear instructions on how to use the calculator.
Creating a Python GUI calculator is a good exercise for learning both basic GUI programming and handling user input and logic in Python. It combines elements of user interface design, event-driven programming, and basic arithmetic operations in a practical application.# Python-GUI-Calculator

#### How it works?

>It has an entrybox that can accept input from the keyboard. Additionally, it also has some buttons which when pressed automatically inserts the corresponding character in the entrybox. After that, when the equal button is clicked, it takes the input from the entrybox and evaluates the result and displayed in entry box.

>If any syntax error encountered in the entry box then a pop up message will be displayed saying that syntax error
